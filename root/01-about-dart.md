# About Dart

> **Programming language** is just a tool to speak to computer. _**Dart**_ is one of the many of them. It is popular with Mobile Developers, for its agility (fast rebuilds) and cross-platform development

{% hint style="info" %}
Nothing too important here, just a general look on what Dart is about. Feel free to skip all the yapping and move to real concepts in Dart from next chapter
{% endhint %}

## _Preview_

_In human language_: Dart allows you to build mobile applications for various devices: iOS, Android, Web and Desktop (basically anything that has computer in it: smartwatch, microwave, your car unless you ride old tanks) all **in one place and at the same time** 😎

For decades, developers were divided into separate armies:

* the iOS guys
* the Android guys
* the Desktop guys

All of them (even while coding the same app) had different code bases, used different languages. It annoyed smart guys from Google and they decided to create Dart (_props to those gigachads_)

## What you should know about Dart?

1. **Strongly typed** - _you must tell Dart what kind of data you want to create and store (must specify the Type of data). However, there are some exceptions, other ways of looking at it (so not all that of a must). That's great in terms of performance and general coding adequacy (no offence to Python devs)_

***

2. **Compiled Language** - _for computer to understand your commands, Dart must first translate your whole app code into **binary code** (the ones and zeros, the only code computers understand). For that, Dart has t**wo important approaches:**_
   * **AOT** (ahead-of-time). Say you are done with your perfects app's code and wanna release it. In that case, Dart can and will translate (_compile_) everything beforehand into zeros and ones. And then executes it all on any device. This way, we get fast, comparably lightweight apps&#x20;
   * **JIT** (just-in-time) - allows you to **build quickly**. Cause while you are building, you want to see the update in real time, right? You don't want to add a little change - compile everything - save - see updates - all over again. So just-in-time compilation, allows you to update your code and see the results immediately with hot reload (compilation happens just when you change smth). You may not understand it yet - but it's _a super gigachad move_ by Dart.

***

3. **Object-Oriented** - _it's a style of coding used by Dart and many other languages. So according to object-oriented programming - everything must be treated like "little princesses" - **objects**:_
   * All princesses may have some cool things (attributes) and cool behaviors (methods)  - _`encapsulation`_&#x20;
   * Princesses can inherit some cool things and behaviours from their parents - _`inheritance`_
   * All princess may do the same things differently - _`polymorphism`_
   * And ofc, princesses may have secrets, some hidden stuff, hidden talents. You don't need to know everything to interact with them, for example if you know their insta and its public you can chat -\
     &#xNAN;_`abstraction`_

4. **Used by Flutter** (the sigma of cross platform development). Flutter is a framework built by Dart for cross platform application development. Think of Flutter as the child-tool created by Dart. So to build your billion dollar app, you use Flutter.&#x20;
