## <mark style="color:$success;">Hi👋</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:$success;">My name is</mark> <mark style="color:$success;"></mark><mark style="color:$success;">**Bekzat**</mark><mark style="color:$success;">. I am currently a Flutter Mobile Dev.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:$success;">My mission is to help people avoid my mistakes:</mark> <mark style="color:$success;"></mark>_<mark style="color:$success;">not paying enough attention to the fundamentals - the cores of Dart language.</mark>_&#x20;

<mark style="color:$success;">Believe me, this boring stuff will save you from lots of mental breakdowns. So, whether you are a beginner and chose to learn Dart (which is highly unlikely) or you come from other languages - this is the place where you build your foundation to the world of Mobile Development</mark>

## Prerequisites

* [ ] **Technical Background:** I won't cover the installation, coding setup part - most likely you don't need that. Please mind installing the latest stable version of Dart and using whatever IDE is best for you
* [ ] **Humility**: If you are here and really wanna make use of this repo, consider yourself as an absolute beginner and stay open to anything new
* [ ] **Patience**: Bear with my, at times _cringe_ way of narrating technical terms
* [ ] **Active Reading:** Try everything you see, read and can think of. Make lots of mistakes, question everything

With all that being said, let's jump straight to it 🚀
