# About Dart

## Hi there👋

#### Most likely, you already know another programming language

#### However, even if you don't, this is a great place to start

> **Programming language** is just a tool to speak to computer. _**Dart**_ is one of the many of them. It is popular with Mobile Developers, for its agility (fast rebuilds) and cross-platform development

_In human language_: Dart allows you to build mobile applications for various devices: iOS, Android, Web and Desktop (basicallly anything that has computer in it: smartwatch, microwave, your car unless you ride old tanks) all **IN ONE PLACE, AT THE SAME TIME** 😎

For decades, developers were devided into seperate armies:

* the iOS guys
* the Android guys
* the Desktop guys

All of them (even when coding the same app) had different code bases, used different languages during development. It annoyed some smart guys in Google and they decided to create Dart (_props to those gigachads_)

## What do we know about Dart?

1. **Strongly typed** - _you must tell Dart what kind of data storage you want to create. Ofc, there are some exceptions (you will get them as we go). It has type inference (cool way of saying it can predict the type of data you want to store) + has null safety (edgy way of saying you can't just randomly create deadass variables - they must store smth) - unless you tell it to be dead which is kinda stupid_

2. **Compiled Language** - _for computer to understand your commands, it must first translate your whole app code into **binary code** (the ones and zeros, thats the only thing comps understand). Dart does it in the following ways: **Two important approaches:**_
   * **AOT** (ahead-of-time). Say you are done with your perfects app's code and wanna release it. In that case, Dart can and will translate (compile is the tech term) everything beforehand into zeros and ones. And then excecutes it all on any device
   * **JIT** (just-in-time) - this is tricky. This feature of Dart allows you to **build quickly**. Why? Cause while you are building, you want to see the update in real time right? You don't want to add a little change - compile everything - save - see updates - all over again.So just-in-time compilation, allows you to update your code and see the results immediately with hot reload (compilation happens just when you change smth). You may not understand it yet - but it's _a super gigachad move_ by Dart.

3. **Object-Oriented** - _it's a style of coding used by Dart and many other languages. So according to object-oriented programming - everything must be treated like "little princesses" - **objects**:_
   * All princeses may have some cool things (attributes) and cool behaviours (methods). _encapsulation_.
   * Princesses can inherit some cool things and behaviours from their parents.\
     &#xNAN;_&#x69;nheritance_
   * All princess may do the same things differently. _polymorphism_
   * And ofc, princesses may have secrets, some hidden stuff, hidden talents. You don't need to know everything to interact with them, for example if you know their insta and its public you can chat.\
     &#xNAN;_&#x61;bstraction_

4. **Used by Flutter** (the sigma of cross platform development). Flutter is a framework built by Dart for cross platform application development. Think of Flutter as the child-tool created by Dart. So to build your billion dollar app, you use Flutter (and again, its build in Dart). So before doing that, you must build great foundation with Dart.

### Good luck and lot's of patience:)
